The project branding is 'Synchronization Point - Smart News, Real News' (Кротовиина Історії). It is positioned as an 'Archive of Human History' where an archivist structures the chaos of human history through global news. All SEO metadata and UI elements reflect this 'Smart News' identity, removing legacy 'AI Science Fiction' labels. The platform serves as a daily record generated from real-world events in the USA, Ukraine, Poland, and India.
