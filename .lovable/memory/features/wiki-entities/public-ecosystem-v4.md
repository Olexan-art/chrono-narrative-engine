Updated: now

The Wikipedia entity ecosystem features a public catalog and profile pages with SEO-friendly slugs (e.g., /wiki/name-id_suffix). Entity profiles include Markdown-rendered AI summaries, a 7-day views trend chart, and a visual 'Intersection Graph' mapping relationships between entities based on shared news mentions. The 'Total Rating' is an aggregated metric summing news views, news likes, and caricature engagement. Profiles feature icon-based 'Topics' and top 20 'Keywords' aggregated from linked news. The catalog highlights the top 4 'Trending' entities from the last 72 hours. Administrative tools include AI-powered formatting, a Wikipedia image fetching tool, and an 'Extended Parse' feature for MediaWiki data integration. Caricatures are linked to source news articles and viewable via a lightbox.
