# Memory: features/news/voting-system
Updated: now

The qualitative voting system (Majority likes/Majority against/Balanced) is unified across news articles and Outrage Ink caricatures, hiding raw counts from the public. It uses descriptive labels and icons: 'Majority likes' (Emerald icon with pulse animation and sparkles), 'Majority against' (Rose icon), and 'Approximately equal' (Amber scale icon). Votes are tracked via 'x-visitor-id' headers and protected by RLS.

Admin panel 'Віральність' tab includes external links to open news/caricatures in new tabs for quick access.

The homepage Outrage Ink section also uses qualitative vote indicators (no raw numbers), with animated icons for popular items.
